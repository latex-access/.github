## Welcome to Latex-access
Latex-access, as a Github organisation, is a collation of online entities existing for the purpose of managing and promoting contributions to a Python package, allowing for easier, on-the-fly interaction with raw LaTeX documents for a blind mathematician or scientist. It contains the following viewable data:
* [latex-access](https://github.com/latex-access/latex-access): The main repository containing source code for the package itself, along with the relevant screen reader scripts and plugins.
* [latex-access.github.io](https://github.com/latex-access/latex-access.github.io): Code for the static site hosted by github pages and published [here](https://latex-access.github.io).
* [People](https://github.com/orgs/latex-access/people): There are currently three members (one owner and two collaborators) but only one organisation member as of this writing has publicly disclosed their name, namely [Nathaniel Schmidt](https://github.com/njsch/).
